# E-comerce in Brazil
The aim of this project is to create a multidimensional data model that will be analyzed through a tabular model in PowerBI. The domain of this project is e-commerce in Brazil, focusing on the retail segment of an online sales platform. 
The dataset covers various aspects of the platform's operations, including customer orders, product listings, 
payments, and shipping price. It provides a detailed view of transactions between businesses and consumers, 
capturing data such as order timestamps, product details, customer locations, payment methods, and shipping 
information. The main goals of analyzing this dataset are to compare revenue across different periods, identify 
top-selling products, and evaluate products with growth potential. These insights will help create effective 
marketing strategies, optimize operations, and improve customer satisfaction in the competitive e-commerce 
market.
